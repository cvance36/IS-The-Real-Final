    <p> 

        Carter has been flying drones ever since October of 2020. He recently received his Part 107 Commercial Drone's License and now flys for clients. 

        He is currently attending BYU to receive a degree in business so that he can scale his growing drone photography empire to a global level.  

        He got into drones as a result of his knee injuries and his familys' adventurous lifestyle. It was a way for him to continue to participate  

        in the adventures his family loved to partake in. If you'd like to hire Carter, see his resume
